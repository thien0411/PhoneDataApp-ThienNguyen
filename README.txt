# phoneApps


An app to help people track their cell phone usage. Cell phone plans
for this particular company give you a certain number of minutes every 30 days which
must be used or they are lost (no rollover). We want to track the average number of
minutes used per day and inform the user if they are using too many minutes or can
afford to use more.
